# _Functional Programming Exercises_

_31st May 2024_

#### _Practice recursion and closures_

#### By _**Benson Limo**_

## Description

#### Instructions for coin.js

Create a coin counter application that takes X amount of money (such as $4.99) and determines the exact amount of change needed in quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies. Do not worry about adding a user interface to the application. Instead, focus on writing good tests and functional code.

Part 1
Create a coin counter function that uses recursion to solve the problem.

Part 2
Create a coin counter function that uses a closure that can be used with functions for each type of change (quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies). You can use recursion if you like.
